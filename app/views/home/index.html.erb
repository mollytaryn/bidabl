      <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
      <h2>The members of Gen Y, who, in their mid-twenties and thirties, are the first-time home buyers of today, are the same group of people who took on enormous student-loan debt, either graduated college into a recession, or found themselves in one during that first or second job out of college, and who have seen stagnent wage growth since they entered the work force. And while that all may sound very grim, Gen Y is also the group of people who took the DIY mentality to heart and ran with it, the group who takes advantage of modern technology to make ends meet (think Lyft Drivers, Task Rabbits and Etsy store owners), and the group who have learned to do more with less, especially when house poor. It is for this group of people (of which I am a member), that I built this app. As a first-time homeowner, I am in constant want of help on projects around house, where I can't afford to hire a company, and just wish I could find that talented guy or gal who could help me out in exchange for an amount I can afford to pay, and that would still be meaningful money for them. Here, on bidabl, we'd like to safely and transparently connect that person who needs help on a project, with that person who wants the cash and can get the job done. Let the exchange begin!</h2>
